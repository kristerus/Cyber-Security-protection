[[ETHICAL-HACKING]]
**Cross-site scripting** (XSS) is one of the most common methods hackers use to attack websites. XSS vulnerabilities permit a malicious user to execute arbitrary chunks of JavaScript when other users visit your site.

**XSS is the most common publicly reported security vulnerability, and part of every hackerâ€™s toolkit.

To protect the website, we must escape any characters, with the HTML entity encoding as below:
" &#34

/# &#35

& &#38

' &#39

( &#40

) &#41

/ &#47

; &#59

< &#60
>&#62

#### Most modern browsers escape the input by default
A method worth giving a shot is implementing a content-security policy, mainly using this meta tag:
```xml
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com">
```


##### You need to make sure to avoid inline JavaScript execution!!
In ReactJS all the code in curly braces will be immediately escaped, and it can also be bound with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property, which is named to remind you of the security risk. Any code as below is considered dangerous:
```react
render() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={ __html: dynamicContent } />
}
```

A common practice, is to also make HTTP-Cookies only modified and stored in the browser and not accessible by outter JS commands.
